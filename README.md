# Lend a Hand

**Lend a Hand** is an immersive VR game template project initialy used for the upcoming proof of concept trailer of a VR game named "The Well" and it's being developed in Unreal Engine, aiming to deliver an engaging and highly interactive experience on an alien world. This repository contains the core codebase, assets, and documentation related to the game’s development process.

## Overview

"The Well" takes players to a hostile and mysterious alien planet where they must explore, solve puzzles, and survive encounters using intuitive hand-based VR mechanics. Players will uncover the story of a lone character guided by an AI assistant, navigate dangerous landscapes, and engage in combat with various alien creatures.

## Features

- **VR Mechanics**: The game utilizes custom-designed VR mechanics for realistic hand interactions, inspired by Half-Life: Alyx, including grabbing, aiming, and object manipulation.
- **Unreal Engine Integration**: Built using Unreal Engine, taking full advantage of its capabilities in rendering, physics, and VR support.
- **Environment Design**: Detailed alien landscapes, complete with dynamic lighting, interactive elements, and environmental storytelling.
- **Combat & Puzzle Elements**: Blending combat and puzzle-solving to create diverse gameplay, with unique weapons and items that encourage creative problem-solving.
- **Optimized Performance**: The project is being developed with optimization in mind to ensure smooth performance on VR platforms.
- **Final Trailer Release**: A polished trailer will be released to showcase the game’s mechanics, environments, and story elements as we approach the project’s completion.

## Technologies Used

- **Unreal Engine**: Core game engine used for development, leveraging Blueprints and C++ for custom functionality.
- **VR Integration**: Designed specifically for VR, incorporating advanced hand-tracking and interaction systems.
- **Optimization Tools**: Employing Unreal’s built-in optimization tools to ensure smooth gameplay.

## Project Status

Lend a Hand is currently in active development, with iterative builds and versions being archived periodically to track progress and changes. The project will conclude with a cinematic trailer of "The Well" to encapsulate the game’s and project's vision and provide a glimpse into the final experience.


I'll be sharing updates as I bring **Lend a Hand** to life!
